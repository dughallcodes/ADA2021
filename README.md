Project description: 

  There are two different types of clients for the serivce, one is the android app used to track and interact with the courier, the web app is used by the service user, which wants something to be delivered to them. 
  There are two different types of servers, one used to deliver an API based on the data collected from the couriers in a certain area (usually a city). The second type of server is the one that hosts the webapp and interacts with the users. 
  
User case: 
  
   Joe is hungry, he wants to eat from his favourite place, Shaorma City. He lives far away from that place and he doesn't own a car so he wants the food to be delivered to him. He uses the website to order food from his favourite place. After he places an order that ordered is sent to the corresponding area server which appoints a courier to deliver the food. The courier gets a notification and information about the order and the addresses. The courier delivers the food to Joe and he pays for it.
